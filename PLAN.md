# Academmunicons Font Improvement Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to improve the Academmunicons font project, making it more stable, elegant, and easily deployable/installable.

## 1. Build System Modernization

### Current State
The project currently relies on FontLab 7 for font generation with manual build processes. The source files are in VFJ format, and the distribution is handled through a single ZIP file.

### Proposed Improvements

#### 1.1 Automated Build Pipeline
Implement a Python-based build system using fontmake and fonttools to:
- Convert VFJ source files to UFO format for better version control
- Automate font compilation from UFO sources
- Generate both variable and static font instances
- Create web font formats (WOFF, WOFF2)
- Optimize font files for web usage

#### 1.2 Script Organization
Create a `build/` directory with:
- `build_fonts.py` - Main build script
- `optimize_fonts.py` - Font optimization and subsetting
- `generate_css.py` - CSS generation from font data
- `package_dist.py` - Distribution packaging

## 2. Web Font Integration

### Current State
The font is distributed as TTF files without web-specific optimizations or easy integration methods.

### Proposed Improvements

#### 2.1 Web Font Formats
- Generate WOFF and WOFF2 versions for optimal web performance
- Create subset fonts for specific icon sets (e.g., just Creative Commons, just academic platforms)
- Implement Unicode range subsetting for better loading performance

#### 2.2 CSS Framework
Develop a comprehensive CSS framework similar to Font Awesome:
- `academmunicons.css` - Main CSS file with icon classes
- `academmunicons.min.css` - Minified version
- CSS variables for easy customization
- Utility classes for sizing, animation, and styling
- SCSS source files for advanced customization

#### 2.3 Documentation Website
Create a GitHub Pages site with:
- Interactive icon gallery with search
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for icon codes
- Usage examples and integration guides
- Variable font axis demonstrations
- Changelog and version history

## 3. Package Distribution

### Current State
Manual ZIP file distribution through the repository.

### Proposed Improvements

#### 3.1 NPM Package
Create an NPM package for easy installation:
```json
{
  "name": "@academmunicons/font",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Variable icon font for academics",
  "main": "dist/css/academmunicons.css",
  "files": [
    "dist/",
    "css/",
    "fonts/"
  ]
}
```

#### 3.2 CDN Distribution
- Set up jsDelivr integration for CDN access
- Provide unpkg URLs for quick prototyping
- Version-specific URLs for stability

#### 3.3 Package Managers
- Bower support (though deprecated, still used in academia)
- Composer package for PHP projects
- Ruby gem for Rails applications

## 4. Developer Experience

### Current State
Limited documentation and manual processes.

### Proposed Improvements

#### 4.1 Development Environment
- Docker container with all build dependencies
- VS Code workspace configuration
- Pre-commit hooks for quality checks
- Automated testing for font rendering

#### 4.2 Contributing Guidelines
- Clear contribution guide
- Icon request template
- Design guidelines for new icons
- Code of conduct

#### 4.3 API and Integration
- JavaScript library for dynamic icon insertion
- React/Vue/Angular components
- WordPress plugin
- LaTeX package for academic papers

## 5. Quality Assurance

### Current State
Manual testing only.

### Proposed Improvements

#### 5.1 Automated Testing
- Font validation using fontbakery
- Visual regression testing for icons
- Cross-browser rendering tests
- Accessibility compliance checks

#### 5.2 CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions workflows for:
- Automated builds on push
- Font validation and testing
- Release automation
- Documentation deployment
- Package publishing

## 6. Project Organization

### Current State
Mixed organization with development files in various locations.

### Proposed Structure
